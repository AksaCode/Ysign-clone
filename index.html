                <p>Inery is an open source distributed database with a thriving community of master and light nodes that build the infrastructure of the entire blockchain. It aims to create a fast and more secure data storage platform without the need of an intermediary in the database management system.</p>

                    <p>The decentralized Blockchain-based system is our way to secure and guarantee total privacy during the exchange of information. Encrypted Peer-to-Peer communication enables ySign users to freely and securely communicate with each other without any of their personal data being stored on a central server. This way communication between registered users stays only between themselves and their private data is stored only on their own devices. Since there is no centralized copy of any personal data, there is also no chance to misuse any information about our ySign members.</p>
